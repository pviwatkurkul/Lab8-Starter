Service workers is related to graceful degradation through the principle of displaying reliable output and ensuring that the website is able to function under poor circumstances such as network failures, poor performance, and poor connections. Service Workers aid in allowing the web app to continue executing until it's needed, and such serves as a fallback in case all else fails, reinforcing the principles and practices used in graceful degradation. Being able to save the data despite loss of network, is extremely crucial to ensuring that the user has a decent experience and can still utilize the service. This allows your web app or website to be robust, resilient, prepared for any hiccups that can potentially lose hundreds of users from the lack of covering the obscure corner cases.
